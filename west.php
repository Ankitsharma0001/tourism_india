            <p>History of India dates back to the time when the earliest civilizations started emerging. Fertile land and 
               wide variety of geographical features here were the reasons of it being a seat of some of the much 
               researched cultures. Not only this, India has seen many famed kingdoms and dynasties emerge, reach 
               unfathomable heights and fall.
               All of these kingdoms, civilizations, cultures and the native people have together contributed to shaping
               the heritage treasure trove of India
