            <p>Venkateswara Temple is a landmark Vaishnavite temple situated in the hill town of Tirumala at Tirupati in 
                Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, India. The Temple is dedicated to Lord Sri Venkateswara, an incarnation
                of Vishnu.Hence the place has also got the name Kaliyuga Vaikuntham and the Lord is referred to  Kaliyuga 
                Prathyaksha Daivam. The temple was built by Thondaiman, the ruler of Thondaimandalam, ancient Tamil nadu. 
                Initially, a Gopuram (mean, entrance of any temple) and Prakaras (means, outer walls of any Temple) were 
                built by Thondaiman. After that, the Cholas  and Pallavas (during 9th century) greatly developed the temple and gave a new look. Later on, the rulers of Vijayanagar Empire (specially 
                King Krishnadeva Raya) during 14th to 15th century had donated lots of gold and jewels.
