            <p>North India is a loosely defined region consisting of the northern part of India. The dominant geographical 
              features of North India are the Indus-Gangetic Plain and the Himalayas, which demarcate the region from the
              Tibetan Plateau and Central Asia.
              The term North India has varying definitions—the Ministry of Home Affairs in its Northern Zonal Council 
              Administrative division included the states of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and 
              Rajasthan and Union Territories of Delhi, Chandigarh.[1][4] while the Ministry of Culture in its North 
              Culture Zone includes the state of Uttarakhand but excludes Delhi[2] whereas the Geological Survey of India 
              includes Uttar Pradesh and Delhi but excludes Rajasthan and Chandigarh.
              The languages that have official status in one or more of the states and union territories located in North 
             India are Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi and English.</p>

            <p>Taj Mahal is located in the historical city of Agra. It was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a 
                memorial for his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Constructed entirely out of white marble in the 17th century, 
                it is among the finest edifices of Mughal architecture. Recognised by the UNESCO as a world heritage site,
                this monument is also considered to be one of the seven wonders of the modern world. Every year visitors 
                numbering more than the entire population of Agra pass through the magnificent gates to catch a glimpse of
                this breathtaking monument, and only a few leave disappointed. Shah Jahan said about the Taj that it made
                "the sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes".

            <p>The Gurdwara sahib is built around a man-made pool (Sarovar) that was completed by Guru Ram Das in 1577.
               Guru Arjan, the fifth Guru of Sikhism, requested Sai Mian Mir – a Muslim Pir of Lahore, to lay its foundation
               stone in 1589.[1] In 1604, Guru Arjan placed a copy of the Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib, calling the site 
               Ath Sath Tirath (lit. "shrine of 68 pilgrimages"). The Gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt by the Sikhs 
               after it became a target of persecution and was destroyed several times by the Muslim armies from Afghanistan
               and the Mughal Empire. The army led by Ahmad Shah Abdali, for example, demolished it in 1757 and again 
               in 1762, then filled the pool with garbage.
